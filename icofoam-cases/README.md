icoFoam Solver Test Cases:
--------------------------
(1) pipe-parabolic-inlet: Axi-symmetric Pipe Flow with parabolic velocity inlet
(2) pipe-parabolic-time-varying-inlet: Axi-symmetric Pipe Flow with parabolic velocity inlet with oscillation in time
(3) cylinder-2d-Re=40-steady: 2D uniform flow inlet (scale=0.01) for Re = 40 with clustering over cylinder multi-block
(4) lid-driven-cavity-Re=5000: 2D lid-driven laminar cavity flow steady up to Re = 5000 with mesh clustering on walls
(5) thermalChannel2D: 2D channel flow forced convection with constant inlet temperature and iso-thermal walls
