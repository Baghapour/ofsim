icoFoam Solver Test Cases:
--------------------------
(1) pipe-parabolic-inlet             : Axi-symmetric Pipe Flow with parabolic velocity inlet
(2) pipe-parabolic-time-varying-inlet: Axi-symmetric Pipe Flow with parabolic velocity inlet with oscillation in time
(3) cylinder-2d-Re=40-steady         : 2D uniform flow inlet (scale=0.01) for Re = 40 with clustering over cylinder multi-block
(4) lid-driven-cavity-Re=5000        : 2D lid-driven laminar cavity flow steady up to Re = 5000 with mesh clustering on walls
(5) thermal-channel-2d               : 2D channel flow forced convection with constant inlet temperature and iso-thermal walls
(6) buoyant-cavity-2d-dT=15          : 2D natural convection in square cavity laminar case constant properties up to T1-T0 = 15
(7) orifice-plate-U=3ms-1            : 2D Axis-symmetric orifice-plate Laminar flow with Parabolic inlet (Note: calc was not accurate enough for wedges)
